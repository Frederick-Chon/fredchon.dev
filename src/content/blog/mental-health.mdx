#### Job searching in tech is tough

Searching for a job in tech can be exhausting. Rejections, ghosting, and endless applications can take a toll on your confidence and motivation. With so much competition and an uncertain job market, it's easy to feel discouraged, but you're not alone in this.

#### Mental health matters more than ever

The stress of job hunting isn't just frustrating, it can seriously impact your mental health. Anxiety, self-doubt, and burnout are common, especially when progress feels slow. Taking care of your mind is just as crucial as perfecting your resume or practicing coding challenges.

#### How to stay motivated and mentally strong

Instead of treating the job search like a non-stop grind, set boundaries to avoid burnout. Don't spend all day applying. Schedule breaks and make time for yourself. Celebrate small wins, whether it's landing an interview, improving your resume, or simply sending out a few applications. Surround yourself with supportive friends, family, or online communities where you can vent, share advice, and remind yourself that this process is temporary.

Upskilling and working on projects can help you stay engaged, but don't feel pressured to be productive every waking moment. Rest is just as important as progress. Above all, practice self-compassion. A rejection doesn't mean you aren't talented or capable, it's just part of the process.


#### Don't give up, the right opportunity will come

The market is tough right now, but persistence pays off. Every rejection brings you one step closer to the right fit. It's okay to take a step back when needed, but don't let setbacks define your journey. You will land a role. Sometimes it just takes time.

If you're struggling, know that you're not alone. Keep pushing forward, take care of yourself, and trust that the right opportunity is ahead.
