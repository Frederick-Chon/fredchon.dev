It's Memorial Day, and while this day carries deep meaning for many, it's also become a time for pause—a chance to reflect, reset, and check in with yourself. After a packed few days at EDC, that pause feels especially *needed*.

From May 16 to 18, I was surrounded by sound, lights, energy, and some of the most vibrant people I've ever met. EDC was everything I hoped it would be—euphoric, overwhelming, healing. There's something about being immersed in that kind of environment, where nothing exists except the music, the people around you, and the moment you're in. It made me feel incredibly alive.

But coming back from that kind of high, real life hits differently. It's quieter. Slower. The contrast is sharp, but I think that's the point. You need both.

#### Resetting after the highs

EDC reminded me of how powerful connection and presence can be. But it also reminded me how easy it is to lose touch with your own rhythm. Coming home, I've been intentionally slowing things down. Sleeping in a bit. Going for long walks. Journaling more. Letting the dust settle—not just from the trip, but from the mental noise I've been carrying with me for weeks.

Sometimes you don't realize how tired you are until you stop.

#### Reflection and Memorial Day

Memorial Day is a day of remembrance. For many, it's about honoring lives lost in service. For others, it's a quieter moment to remember people, chapters, or parts of yourself that are gone. Today, I'm holding a bit of all of that.

I'm thinking about how fast life moves, and how easy it is to get caught up in chasing the next thing, especially during a job search or uncertain season. But days like today remind me how important it is to pause. To feel something. To be grateful.


#### Song of the day

It wouldn't be another blog post without music. Today's track is **Poem of Sky and Sea (Robotaki Remix)**, a tribute to Nujabes (Seba Jun), a legendary producer known for blending hip-hop with jazz and creating some of the most emotionally resonant beats of his time. This remix is mellow, soulful, and quietly uplifting—exactly the kind of energy I've been leaning into lately.

I know I usually post EDM, but after EDC, I might be a little EDM'd out. I've been drawn to tracks that feel more grounded and reflective, and this remix hits that sweet spot. It captures Nujabes' signature depth and introspection, with Robotaki's touch adding a modern glow that feels both nostalgic and fresh.

It's the kind of track that makes you pause for a moment, look out the window, and just feel.
