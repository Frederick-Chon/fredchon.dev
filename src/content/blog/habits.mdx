Being between jobs can feel strange—like hitting pause while the rest of the world keeps moving. The initial rush of free time quickly gives way to anxiety, self-doubt, and an overwhelming pressure to stay productive. But in this space, I've realized it's also an opportunity to reset. Instead of just focusing on job applications, I've been working on building habits that will serve me long after I land my next role.

#### Waking up with purpose

I'm not setting a 5AM alarm or anything dramatic but I *am* trying to wake up at a consistent time, make my bed, and start the day intentionally. I used to roll out of bed straight into a job board or my inbox. Now, I take 15-30 minutes to stretch, drink water, and plan the day before jumping into anything career-related. It's a small shift, but it helps me feel more grounded and in control.

#### Staying commited to the gym

Exercise has become one of the most important anchors in my routine. Staying consistent with the gym gives me structure and something to look forward to. It's not just about staying in shape—lifting, cardio, or even just stretching resets my mindset and keeps me sane. On days when motivation is low or rejection emails pile up, getting a workout in reminds me that I'm still showing up for myself. It's become a non-negotiable, and honestly, one of the best things I've done for both my mental and physical health.

#### Limiting doomscrolling

It's so easy to fall into the trap of checking LinkedIn every 15 minutes, refreshing job listings, or reading discouraging headlines. I've started setting limits—no job boards after 6 PM and a daily screen time cap on social media. I've been using that time to read more, journal, or just relax without staring at a screen.


#### Practicing mindful learning

I'm still brushing up on technical skills, but I'm approaching it with more intention. Instead of jumping between tutorials or cramming too much, I focus on one thing each week—maybe it's a React pattern, maybe it's writing a small blog post like this one. Learning feels a lot more manageable this way, and I actually retain more.


#### Staying connected without overexplaining

I've been making more of an effort to reach out to friends and former coworkers. I used to hesitate because I didn't want every conversation to revolve around my job status—but I've realized I don't owe anyone a full update. Sometimes just checking in or catching up is enough, and it's been a good reminder that I'm not going through this alone.


#### Being kinder to myself

Some days feel productive. Some don't. I'm learning to be okay with that. Rest is just as important as effort, and beating myself up over a slow day doesn't help. I'm trying to practice more self-compassion and remind myself that this season is temporary—and that I'm doing the best I can.

#### Song of the Day

This track hits hard, both emotionally and sonically. It's dark and cinematic, yet somehow uplifting. Memory Reboot feels like standing at a crossroads, where setbacks and uncertainty meet a deep sense of possibility. It captures emotions like depression, motivation, betrayal, and hope—all without a single lyric.

It reminds me that even in the middle of struggle, something is shifting. It feels like the moment just before a breakthrough, when everything is about to change.
