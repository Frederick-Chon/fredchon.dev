#### The role of music in my productivity

Music has always been a huge part of my life, but over time, I've realized just how much it impacts my focus, creativity, and overall productivity—whether I'm coding, writing, or even pushing through a tough workout at the gym. The right soundtrack can completely shift my mindset, helping me get in the zone, spark new ideas, or unwind after a long day. Different genres serve different purposes, and I've found that being intentional with my music choices makes a huge difference in how I work and feel.

#### Music for deep focus

When I need to lock in and get things done, instrumental and electronic music are my go-to. Lyrics can be distracting when I'm deep in thought, so I tend to go for ambient electronic, lo-fi beats, and liquid drum & bass. These genres provide a steady rhythm without pulling me away from my work.

Some of my go-to choices:
  * Lo-fi beats - Perfect for writing or coding sessions where I need to think clearly but stay relaxed.
  * Liquid drum & bass - Keeps me energized while still maintaining a chill atmosphere.
  * Classical & film scores - If I really need to block out distractions, something cinematic like Hans Zimmer or Ludovico Einaudi works wonders.

#### Music for creativity & inspiration

When I'm brainstorming ideas or working on something more creative, I lean towards synthwave, alternative, and melodic electronic tracks. There's something about their nostalgic, uplifting vibe that makes me think more freely and feel more inspired.

Some tracks that never fail to spark creativity:

  * Synthwave & chillwave - Artists like HOME, Kavinsky, and The Midnight create the perfect balance of retro and futuristic sounds.
  * Alternative & indie electronic - Something about artists like ODESZA or Bonobo just brings out ideas I wouldn't normally think of.
  * Ambient wave & phonk - More atmospheric tracks, like those from Skeler or øneheart, can put me in a flow state where ideas just come naturally.


#### Music for the gym & motivation

Working out is just as much a mental game as it is physical, and the right playlist makes all the difference. I need high-energy, bass-heavy tracks to push through tough sets or cardio sessions.

Some of my top picks for workouts:
  * Hardwave & drift phonk - Artists like Skeler and Kordhell keep the energy levels high.
  * Trap & electronic remixes - Something intense with a strong drop helps when I need that extra push.
  * Old-school rap & hip-hop - A mix of classics and modern tracks keeps the motivation going.

#### Music for unwinding & resetting

Productivity isn't just about pushing forward—it's also about knowing when to take a break. Music helps me shift gears when I need to unwind after a long day or reset my focus.

For unwinding, I go for:

  * Chill acoustic & indie - Mellow tracks from artists like Novo Amor or Hollow Coves help me slow down.
  * Jazz & soul - Something smooth and timeless, like Chet Baker or Tom Misch, is always a good choice.
  * Rain sounds & nature soundscapes - When I need complete relaxation, instrumental nature sounds help me clear my mind.
